# boring-mind-machine

**boring mind machine** is a set of boring base classes for building awesome bot flocks.

classes:

* [BoringLumberjack](#lumberjack.md)
* [BoringKeymaker](#keymaker.md)
* [BoringShepherd](#shepherd.md)
* [BoringSheep](#sheep.md)

The BoringLumberjack isn't really a class as much as a 
one time call to the logging module to set logging preferences.

This follows the mind machine architecuture:

* Keymaker
* Shepherd
* Sheep

boring mind machine is not capable of much, 
but being boring also makes boring mind machine 
easier to understand.
