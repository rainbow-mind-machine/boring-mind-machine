# boring-mind-machine

**boring mind machine** is a set of boring base classes for building awesome bot flocks.

classes:

* [BoringLumberjack](lumberjack.md)
* [BoringKeymaker](keymaker.md)
* [BoringShepherd](shepherd.md)
* [BoringSheep](sheep.md)

(The BoringLumberjack is so boring, it doesn't count as a class.)

This follows the **mind machine** architecuture:

* Keymaker
* Shepherd
* Sheep

**boring mind machine** is not capable of much, 
but being boring means you are easy to understand.
