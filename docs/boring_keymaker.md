# Boring Keymaker and Boring OAuth Keymaker

There are two base Keymaker classes implemented by 
boring mind machine; they are `BoringKeymaker` and
`BoringOAuthKeymaker`.

Technically a Keymaker can inherit from BoringKeymaker
and use any authentication method, but in practice all
Keymakers are OAuth Keymakers.

(TODO: add list of important class methods)
(TODO: how is oauth keymaker extended - what method)
